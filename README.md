> **Minimal proof engine for code changes** ‚Äî Open-core implementation with cryptographic integrity, automated security gating, and comprehensive quality assurance.

## üéØ What it is

Proof Engine for Code is a **minimal proof engine** that enforces code quality and security through cryptographic integrity checks, automated static analysis, and comprehensive testing. It provides:

- **üîí Cryptographic Integrity**: Merkle tree-based proof journaling
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security Gating**: SAST, OSV vulnerability scanning, and path-based rules
- **üìä Quality Assurance**: Linting, type checking, test coverage, and API diff analysis
- **üîÑ Reproducibility**: UV lock files, Docker digest pinning, and build manifest generation
- **üìù Proof Delta**: Automated PR analysis with detailed change reports

## üöÄ Quickstart

### For Third-Party Repositories

1. **Create a workflow file** `.github/workflows/proof.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI with Proof Engine for Code (Lite)
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  proof:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: RomainPeter/proof-engine-code@v0.1.1
```

2. **Open a PR** and observe:
   - ‚úÖ **`code_proof`** status check running
   - üìù **Proof Delta** comment with detailed analysis
   - üîí **Proof artifacts** generated in `.proof/`

### For This Repository

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/RomainPeter/proof-engine-code.git
cd proof-engine-code

# Install dependencies
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r spec_pack/requirements.lock.txt

# Run S1 checks (minimal obligations)
python spec_pack/tools/run_s1.py

# Verify proof artifacts
ls .proof/
# merkle.json, ruff.json, sast.json, sbom.json, coverage.xml, test-report.xml
```

## üìã Four Scenarios

### 1. **Comment-Only Changes**
- Documentation updates, README changes
- **Proof Delta**: Minimal impact, no security concerns
- **Gating**: Passes with low-risk classification

### 2. **Behavior Changes**
- Bug fixes, performance improvements
- **Proof Delta**: Behavior analysis, test coverage impact
- **Gating**: Requires test updates, coverage validation

### 3. **Interface Gate**
- API changes, function signatures
- **Proof Delta**: Breaking vs. minor vs. patch classification
- **Gating**: Requires API diff analysis, semantic versioning

### 4. **Dependencies**
- Package updates, security patches
- **Proof Delta**: Dependency impact analysis
- **Gating**: OSV vulnerability scanning, SBOM generation

## üîç Verify Evidence

All proof artifacts can be independently verified:

```bash
# Recalculate Merkle root
python spec_pack/tools/merkle_hasher.py --in .proof --out .proof/merkle_verify.json

# Compare with original
diff .proof/merkle.json .proof/merkle_verify.json
# Should be identical (same Merkle root)
```

**Merkle Root Verification**: The cryptographic integrity of all proof artifacts is guaranteed through Merkle tree hashing. Any modification to the evidence will result in a different root hash, ensuring tamper detection.

## üìÅ Generated Artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose | Format |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `.proof/merkle.json` | Cryptographic integrity | JSON |
| `.proof/ruff.json` | Linting results | JSON |
| `.proof/sast.json` | Security analysis | JSON |
| `.proof/sbom.json` | Software Bill of Materials | JSON |
| `.proof/coverage.xml` | Test coverage | XML |
| `.proof/test-report.xml` | Test results | XML |
| `.proof/api_diff.json` | API change analysis | JSON |
| `.proof/build_manifest.json` | Build reproducibility | JSON |
